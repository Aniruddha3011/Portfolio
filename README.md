# Portfolio

# Project Description
This repository contains a responsive portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a modern design with smooth animations, interactive elements, and dynamic content. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key features and functionalities implemented in the project.

# Key Features:
Responsive Layout:

  The website adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
  Media queries are used to adjust the layout for different screen widths (e.g., 1200px, 991px, 768px, etc.).

# Sticky Header with Navigation:
    A fixed header remains at the top of the page as users scroll.
    Navigation links highlight the active section as the user scrolls through the page, offering better UX.
    Mobile-friendly menu toggle with a hamburger icon (#menu-icon) for smaller screens.
    The navigation menu closes when a user scrolls or selects a section.

# Smooth Scrolling:
  Smooth scrolling is enabled across sections when clicking on navigation links, enhancing the user experience.

# Dynamic Text Animation (Typed.js):
  The "multiple text" element displays dynamic typing animations that loop through "Java Developer" and "Frontend Developer."

# ScrollReveal Animations:
  ScrollReveal library is used for animations when elements come into view.
  Sections like .homecontent, .servicescontainer, .portfolio, and .contact form are revealed with animated effects on scroll.

# Progress Circle (Skills/Percentage):
  The website features progress circles that visually represent skills or data with a percentage.
  Each circle fills up based on the data attribute data-percentage, updating the percentage dynamically using JavaScript.

# Read More/Read Less Functionality:
  Each service box has a "Read More" button, which toggles between a short description and a full description.
    Clicking the button switches the content and updates the text to "Show Less" when expanded.

# Mobile-First Design:
  The website is designed with mobile devices in mind, using flexbox and media queries to ensure proper scaling on smaller screens.
    Large elements and images resize dynamically, while content stacks vertically for better readability.

# Technologies Used:
  HTML: For structuring the content of the website.
    CSS: For styling and creating the responsive layout, animations, and hover effects.
    JavaScript: For implementing interactive features like the sticky header, navigation highlight, progress circles, and dynamic text animation.
    Typed.js: For the typing effect that cycles through different text values.
    ScrollReveal.js: For creating scroll-based animations for a dynamic and engaging user experience.
